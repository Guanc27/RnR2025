# for comparing algorithms, compare artifacts (unwanted shapes, if the hand mesh has a spike etc.), skinny triangles (too many triangles? 4:1 or 3:1 is ideal)
# (more general) vertex decomposition is for re-meshing (MeshLab has many diff ways of decomposing vertices, also has ones for edges) 
# decomposing => smoother surfaces and easier to process
# applications maybe deep learning for object recognition/ medical imaging/ molecular simulation
