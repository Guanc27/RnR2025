# INTERPOLATORY 
# 1:3 division, flips edges, after two iterations \exists 9 triangles and edges are split to 3
# new vertices have deg 6 and deg of old ones don't change 
# Labsik et. al. also uses adaptive refinement (triangles which do not satisfy a flatness criterion is split)
# i.e. high local curv => more refinement 
# coord for new vertex is q^{k+1} = 32/81*(p1^k+p2^k+p3^k) - 1/81*(p4^k+p5^k+p6^k) - 1/81*(p7^k+...+p12^k)
# above computed based on x=5/3

# adv: 
    # allows computation of more refinement levels until prescribed mesh complexity is reached
    # doesn't hv the problem of holes, no edges are split 
    # sike, there's a bunch of holes, but seems to be boundary cases and where valence is high
# disadv: 
    #
